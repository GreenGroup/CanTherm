	resulted in a C2H5 + O2 submechanism which was either used directly

	or as part of a larger extended mechanism to predict the temp. and
	pressure dependencies of the overall loss of Et and of the yields

	over this pressure range, the vinyl chloride yield cannot be ascribed
	unambiguously to an addn.-elimination process. The propylene yield
	from reaction 1 is 2-4 times smaller than the ethylene yield from
	C2H5 + O2 over the pressure range 0.4-100 Torr, while the vinyl chloride
	yield from reaction 2 is 40 times smaller between 1 and 10 Torr.
	This is consistent with more efficient stabilization of the excited
	propylperoxy relative to the ethylperoxy adduct caused by the presence
	of addnl. vibrational modes. The markedly smaller ambient temp. vinyl
	chloride yield from reaction 2 may result from a combination of more
	efficient stabilization resulting from the lower frequency of the
	C-Cl bond and the redn. of the C-H bond reactivity upon Cl substitution.

	radicals. I oxidizes only one sixth as fast as isobutane at the same

  abstract = {The present investigation is a rather substantial extension and elaboration
	of the author's previous work on the same reaction. In this article
	four primary objectives are accomplished:. 1. It is shown quant.
	how sensitive the high-temp. rate coeff. k(T) is to E02, the threshold
	energy of the transition state for direct mol. elimination of HO2
	from ethylperoxy radical (C2H5O2), thus deducing a value of E02 =
	-3.0 kcal/mol (measured from reactants). 2. The result is derived
	that k0(T) ~ k'...(T) in the high-temp. regime, where k0(T) is the
	zero-pressure rate coeff., and k'...(T) is the infinite-pressure
	rate coeff. for the bimol. channel. 3. Most importantly, the three
	different regimes of the reaction (low-temp., transition, and high-temp.)
	are discussed in terms of the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of G,
	the transition matrix of the master equation. The transition regime
	is shown to be a region of avoided crossing between the two chem.
	significant eigenvalue curves in which the thermal rate coeff. k(T,p)
	jumps from one eigenvalue to the other. This jump is accompanied
	by a "mixing" of the corresponding eigenvectors, through which both
	eigenvectors deplete the reactant. The onset of the high-temp. regime
	is triggered by reaching the "stabilization limit" of the ethylperoxy
	adduct, a limit that is induced by a shift in equil. of the stabilization
	reaction. The identification of the prompt and secondary HO2 formed
	by the reaction with these eigenvalue/eigenvector pairs leads to
	good agreement between theory and the expts. of Clifford et al. 4.
	Lastly, the master equation results are described in terms of a set
	of elementary reactions and phenomenol. rate coeffs. [on SciFinder

  abstract = {A review. The reactions of alkyl radicals (R) with mol. oxygen (O2)
	are crit. components in chem. models of tropospheric chem., hydrocarbon
	flames, and autoignition phenomena. The fundamental kinetics of the
	R + O2 reactions is governed by a rich interplay of elementary phys.
	chem. processes. At low temps. and moderate pressures, the reactions
	form stabilized alkylperoxy radicals (RO2), which are key chain carriers
	in the atm. oxidn. of hydrocarbons. At higher temps., thermal dissocn.
	of the alkylperoxy radicals becomes more rapid and the formation
	of hydroperoxyl radicals (HO2) and the conjugate alkenes begins to
	dominate the reaction. Internal isomerization of the RO2 radicals
	to produce hydroperoxyalkyl radicals, often denoted by QOOH, leads
	to the prodn. of OH and cyclic ether products. More crucially for
	combustion chem., reactions of the ephemeral QOOH species are also
	thought to be the key to chain branching in autoignition chem. Over
	the past decade, the understanding of these important reactions has
	changed greatly. A recognition, arising from classical kinetics expts.
	but firmly established by recent high-level theor. studies, that
	HO2 elimination occurs directly from an alkylperoxy radical without
	intervening isomerization has helped resolve tenacious controversies
	regarding HO2 formation in these reactions. Second, the importance
	of including formally direct chem. activation pathways, esp. for
	the formation of products but also for the formation of the QOOH
	species, in kinetic modeling of R + O2 chem. has been demonstrated.
	In addn., it appears that the crucial rate coeff. for the isomerization
	of RO2 radicals to QOOH may be significantly larger than previously
	thought. These reinterpretations of this class of reactions have
	been supported by comparison of detailed theor. calcns. to new exptl.
	results that monitor the formation of products of hydrocarbon radical
	oxidn. following a pulsed-photolytic initiation. In this article,

  abstract = {Large-amplitude motions, particularly internal rotations, are known
	to affect substantially thermodynamic functions and rate constants
	of reactions in which flexible molecules are involved. Up to now
	all methods for computing the partition functions of these motions
	rely on the Pitzer approximation of more than 50 years ago, in which
	the large-amplitude motion is treated in complete independence of
	the other (vibrational) degrees of freedom. In this paper an extended
	hindered-rotor model (EHR) is developed in which the vibrational
	modes, treated harmonically, are correctly separated from the large-amplitude
	motion and in which relaxation effects (the changes in the kinetic-energy
	matrix and potential curvature) are taken into account as one moves
	along the large-amplitude path. The model also relies on a specific
	coordinate system in which the Coriolis terms vanish at all times
	in the Hamiltonian. In this way an increased level of consistency
	between the various internal modes is achieved, as compared with
	the more usual hindered-rotor (HR) description. The method is illustrated
	by calculating the entropies and heat capacities on 1,3-butadiene
	and 1-butene (with, respectively, one and two internal rotors) and
	the rate constant for the addition reaction of a vinyl radical to
	ethene. We also discuss various variants of the one-dimensional hindered-rotor
	scheme existing in the literature and its relation with the EHR model.
	It is argued why in most cases the HR approach is already quite successful.
